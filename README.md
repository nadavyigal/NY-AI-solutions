# NY AI Solutions

The practice site and its delivery system. **Start at
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**: the operating index connecting the
offer, the six-step toolkit that delivers it, the sales assets, the site, and
the evidence record that decides whether the offer survives.

Publishing note: merging to `main` does not publish. The live site is served by
the `sites` remote; publishing is `git push sites main` from an interactive
terminal.

# vinext-starter

A clean full-stack starter running on
[vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext). The starter's optional D1/Drizzle
database and ChatGPT sign-in helpers were removed on 2026-11-14 (unused).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Email and name are intended for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty
`name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Useful Commands

- `npm run dev`: start local development
- `npm run build`: verify the vinext build output
- `npm test`: build the starter and verify its rendered loading skeleton
